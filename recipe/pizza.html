    <h2>Description</h2>
<p>
Pizza is a beloved Italian dish featuring a crispy dough base topped with a variety of ingredients, including tomato sauce, cheese, and your choice of meats or vegetables. To make a traditional pizza, you begin by preparing the dough, which is rolled out and topped with a flavorful tomato sauce. Mozzarella cheese is generously spread on top, and then the pizza is customized with toppings such as pepperoni, mushrooms, or fresh basil. Itâ€™s baked in a hot oven until the crust is golden and the cheese is melted, creating a delicious and versatile dish perfect for any occasion.
