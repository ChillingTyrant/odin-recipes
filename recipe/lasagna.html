    <h2>Description</h2>
<p>
Lasagna is a classic Italian dish made by layering sheets of pasta with a hearty meat sauce, creamy béchamel, and cheese. To start, a rich meat sauce is prepared by cooking ground beef with onions, garlic, and tomato sauce, seasoned with herbs like oregano and basil. While the sauce simmers, a creamy béchamel sauce is made by whisking butter, flour, and milk until smooth. The lasagna is assembled by layering the pasta sheets, meat sauce, béchamel, and mozzarella cheese in a baking dish. It is then baked until golden and bubbly, resulting in a flavorful, comforting meal perfect for family dinners.
